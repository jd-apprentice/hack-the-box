Connect to FTP via anonymous login

```shell
ftp <IP>
```

When prompted for a username, type `anonymous` and press enter. When prompted for a password, press enter.

Download files in the FTP server

```shell
get <file>
```

In the `etc/config/wireless` there is a password
In the `etc/passwd` there is one user with a home which is `netadmin`

With these credentials, we can connect to the SSH server

```shell
ssh netadmin@<IP>
```

We can find the user flag in the home directory of `netadmin`

```shell
cat user.txt
```

Success! We have the user flag. üèÅ
