| ssl-ccs-injection: 
|   VULNERABLE:
|   SSL/TLS MITM vulnerability (CCS Injection)
|     State: VULNERABLE
|     Risk factor: High
|       OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h
|       does not properly restrict processing of ChangeCipherSpec messages,
|       which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to trigger use of a zero
|       length master key in certain OpenSSL-to-OpenSSL communications, and
|       consequently hijack sessions or obtain sensitive information, via
|       a crafted TLS handshake, aka the "CCS Injection" vulnerability.

| ssl-heartbleed: 
|   VULNERABLE:
|   The Heartbleed Bug is a serious vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library. It allows for stealing information intended to be protected by SSL/TLS encryption.
|     State: VULNERABLE
|     Risk factor: High
|       OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 and 1.0.2-beta releases (including 1.0.1f and 1.0.2-beta1) of OpenSSL are affected by the Heartbleed bug. The bug allows for reading memory of systems protected by the vulnerable OpenSSL versions and could allow for disclosure of otherwise encrypted confidential information as well as the encryption keys themselves.

| ssl-poodle: 
|   VULNERABLE:
|   SSL POODLE information leak
|     State: VULNERABLE
|     IDs:  BID:70574  CVE:CVE-2014-3566
|           The SSL protocol 3.0, as used in OpenSSL through 1.0.1i and other
|           products, uses nondeterministic CBC padding, which makes it easier
|           for man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain cleartext data via a
|           padding-oracle attack, aka the "POODLE" issue.
